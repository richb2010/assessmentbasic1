// Planning- they can implement the project successfully with the lowest risk in mind.
// Analysis of Requirements- Look and clearfiy the story 
// Design-  All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions
// Implementation- Testing the software or coding in the program. 
// Testing & Integration- Different parts of the application should also be tested to work seamlessly together—performance test, to reduce any hangs or lags in processing
// Maintain- The Operation and Maintenance phase is still important, though. In this phase, users discover bugs that weren’t found during testing
